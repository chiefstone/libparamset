/**
 * Performs analysis on the #TASK_SET with parameters from #PARAM_SET. After analyze
 * it is possible to extract one consistent #TASK from the #TASK_SET (see
 * #TASK_SET_getConsistentTask) or in case of an error, check if one task from the
 * #TASK_SET stands out as the possible target and give user some hints how to fix.
 * If it is not possible to assume what task the user is trying to accomplish, show
 * user the tasks that have the most similar patterns compared to the given input.
 * (see #TASK_SET_isOneFromSetTheTarget, #TASK_SET_howToRepair_toString and
 * #TASK_SET_suggestions_toString).
 *
 * The analysis and error handling is based on the task \c consistency value. Consistency
 * \c 1.0 means that it is possible to perform the task with given parameters and
 * \b less than \c 1.0 means it is not. The consistency of a task is calculated
 * from command-line parameter groups (see #TASK_SET_add). To get a consistent
 * task, all mandatory parameters must be set and there must not be a single
 * forbidden parameter set. The consistency of a task is calculated as follows:
 *
 * \code{.txt}
 *                    man_mis + atl_mis + forbidden
 * consistency = 1 -  -----------------------------  , where
 *                        man_count + atl_count
 *
 *   atl_count - Count of parameters that are set from group "at least one".
 *   atl_mis   - 0 if at least one parameter from group "at least one" is set, 1 otherwise.
 *   forbidden - Count of forbidden parameters that are set.
 *   man_count - Count of all mandatory parameters.
 *   man_mis   - Count of missing mandatory parameters.
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * During analysis \c consistency of all parameters is calculated and values are
 * sorted starting from the most consistent and ending with least consistent. If
 * two tasks have very similar \c consistency, the weighted comparison is used
 * (the difference is specified with \c sensitivity). If weighted comparison does
 * not give better results, two tasks are considered as equal. Weighted comparison
 * is calculated as described below:
 *
 * \code{.txt}
 * Task A is more consistent when ConsitencyA * WA > ConsistencyB * WB
 *
 * Wx = atl_count_x + man_count_x - set_in_both  , where
 *
 *   atl_count_x - Count of parameters that are set from group "at least one".
 *   man_count_x - Count of parameters that are set from group "mandatory".
 *   set_in_both - All parameter that are set in both A nd B.
 * \endcode
 *
 * \param task_set		#TASK_SET object.
 * \param set			#PARAM_SET object.
 * \param sensitivity	Analyze sensitivity .
 * \return #PST_OK if successful, error code otherwise. Some more common error
 * codes: #PST_TASK_SET_HAS_NO_DEFINITIONS and #PST_TASK_UNABLE_TO_ANALYZE_PARAM_SET_CHANGED.
