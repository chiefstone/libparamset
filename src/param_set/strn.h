/**
 * This function works similar to the #PST_snprintf but is used to print text for
 * command-line help. Formatter can:
 *
 *  + Print formatted text (\c desc) thats maximum length (including indention) is \c rowLen.
 *  + Print indented text (\c desc) where indention is size of \c indent. See Example 1.
 *  + Print indented text (\c desc) where next line has extra indention in size of \c nxtLnIndnt. See Example 2.
 *  + Print a header in size of \c headerLen. It is composed of \c paramName and \c delimiter (including \c indent). If real header is larger than \c headerLen, it is printed without delimiter on the first line. In that case \c delimiter is printed on the next row followed by description (\c desc). See Example 3 and Example 4.
 *
 * Usage and examples:
 * \code{.txt}
 *
 * [          maximum row size           ]
 *
 * Regular text with indention:
 * [     indent      ][    text  line 1  ]
 * [     indent      ][    text  line N  ]
 * Example 1. (indent = 2, headerLen = 0, delimiter = '\0', nxtLnIndnt = 0, paramName = NULL, rowLen = 10):
 *     "1234567890"
 *     "  this is "
 *     "  sample"
 *
 * Regular text with extra indention from next row:
 * [indent][         text line 1         ]
 * [indent][eint][   text line 2         ]
 * [indent][eint][   text line N         ]
 * Example 2. (indent = 2, headerLen = 0, delimiter = '\0', nxtLnIndnt = 2, paramName = NULL, rowLen = 10):
 *     "1234567890"
 *     "  this is "
 *     "    sample"
 *     "    text  "
 *
 * Parameter description with indention:
 * [header][delimiter][    desc. line 1  ]
 * [     indent      ][    desc. line N  ]
 * Example 3. (indent = 2, headerLen = 8, delimiter = '-', nxtLnIndnt = 0, paramName = "-a", rowLen = 20):
 *     "123456789_1234567890"
 *     "  -a  - this is my  "
 *     "        description "
 *
 * Parameter description with indention where header is larger than expected:
 * [ too large header]
 * [indent][delimiter][   desc. line 1   ]
 * [indent           ][   desc. line N   ]
 * Example 4. (indent = 2, headerLen = 8, delimiter = '-', nxtLnIndnt = 0, paramName = "-a", rowLen = 20):
 *     "123456789_1234567890"
 *     "  --long            "
 *     "      - this is long"
 *     "        description "

 *
 * \param buf			Pointer to buffer.
 * \param buf_len		The size of the buffer.

 * \param rowLen		The overall size of the line.
 * \param paramName		Parameter name used to compose header.
 * \param delimiter		Delimiter character used for delimiter that separates parameter name from description.
 * \param desc		Format string, parameter description.
 * \param ...			Extra parameters for formatting.
 * \return The number of characters written, not including terminating \c null character. On error \c  0 is returned.
